      <p id="shaila-A">Shaila Moulee is a Web and App Development student at Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical Education High School. She is currently a junior student who is eager to work towards her newly discovered goal of pursuing a career in the field of Computer Science. Shaila remains determined to increase her knowledge about computer languages [especially Python] given that she is seated in a class centered around the priciples of programming and prototyping. <br><br>

Shaila values her family, education, and many other aspects of life that continue to define the nature of her persona. She enjoys writing poetry and creating multimedia pieces that give voice to her thoughts and emotions. And although her Bengali-American background carries fragments of her identity, Shaila armors herself in the cloak of faith as she is a practicing muslim who strives to increase her iman.<br><br>

In spite of the hurdles that often impede upon the shortened path of life, Shaila has guarded her soul and held onto all that ground her character. She is a diligent student, a loving daughter, and a compassionate friend who always makes an effort to shower her loved ones with profound love and respect. Shaila is a pink lotus that remains still in a sea cloaked with mud.
